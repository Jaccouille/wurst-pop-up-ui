# wurst-pop-up-ui
Create a pop up frame upon triggered event

[Custom fdf file](https://github.com/Jaccouille/wurst-pop-up-ui/blob/main/imports/PopUp.fdf) define a frame with 1 background and 3 icons, centered icon has its borders removed for clarity, remove [this line](https://github.com/Jaccouille/wurst-pop-up-ui/blob/main/imports/PopUp.fdf#L32) if you want to keep the borders


For some reasons it doesn't work as a dependency, you need to add the .toc and .fdf files from the imports folder into your own project's imports folder.

Still a bit clunky, haven't tested on multiplayer yet.
Only tested on Patch 1.32.9
